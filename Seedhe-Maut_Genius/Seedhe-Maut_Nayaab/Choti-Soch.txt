4 ContributorsChoti Soch LyricsOn “Choti Soch”, the duo implore against the narrow-minded, closed-off sections of society who define the morality of the world we live in.
Ye
Choti soch
Khuli chhoot
Andha paisa
Tadi khoob
Mere jaisa
Hai ni tu
Mere jaise
Bethe door
Choti soch
Khuli choot
Andha paisa
Ye
Choti soch
Khuli chhoot
Andha paisa
Tadi khoob
Mere jaisa
Hai ni tu
Mere jaise
Bethe door
Choti soch
Khuli choot
Andha paisa

Tadi khoob
Jaa khate hai hum vaha pe thooko ni
Nootan hai paise ki tootan ni
Banawati taakatein teri
Jab mara leke jaega upar nahi
Ye Choti soch
Ye Khuli chhoot
Ye Badi chonch
Ye Sadhi thoot
Ye Andha paisa
Aur ye gadi tu
Jab mara leke jayega upar nahi
Sach hai doot
Bolgye jhoot
Choti soch soch soch
De gaye chhoot
Rahe tabhi doob
Tadi khoob
Andha paisa

Question, Shashi ka naam kahan se aaya bhai?
Bhai Aastik ne pehla sawaal pucha hai kode
Thoda samjhana chahega?
This is a dedication to like, my father bro who passed away
To way of mean, jo abhi boht publicize kar raha hai
Jo abhi news pe boht aara hai, ye shit
Iski wajah se maine naam isiliye rakha kyunki
It's a fucking trip bro kyunki, I want a fucking big show ki
It's treacherous, it's fucking personal hit and note
Isiliye wo naam, It's like a dedication to my father was never around bachpan se
Because I never got to him and never got to keep peace of legacy
I made Peace of legacy of my own to remember him by bro
That's why it's called Shashi, bro
