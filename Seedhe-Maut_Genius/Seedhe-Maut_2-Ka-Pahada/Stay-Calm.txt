Getting up everyday with (getting up everyday)
Sad faces in front of you (front of you!)
I wish I could say
Everything is okay
But its not and its bad how I'm treating you
And I feel you after all
Its the blood that be runnin' in my veins too
To be true, its hard
I'm tryin' to play my part
In helping you with all the sh*t that you're going through
What else am I supposed to do
I got my own path to choose
Goin' all in I got people to prove
Bulldozin' in I got mountains to move
Chasin' my dreams
Caught on the line
Lot to lose, and
Lot to find
How many make it, atleast I'm tryin'
Lot going on but I guess I'm doing fine
Imma grind till I shine, we define fresh
For what I've been seeing there's no progress
From what I've been hearing there's no contest
But you're speaking a lot, you should talk less
You never know what's coming, this a bomb threat (huh)
Wipe that cold sweat
I'm unarmed but I got a pen to put you to rest
But I picture the rest
Got a lot of people to address
(wooh!)

Stay Calm (stay calm!)
Life's good (lifes good!)
Whatever happens in life (in life!)
We doin' what we should (what we should)
So stay calm!
And stay alarmed
Keep your head up and rule (head up and rule)
Keep your head up and conquer (head up and conquer)
Keep your head up and rule
Let's go
