Ye mera khel meri chal hai
Ye mera khel meri chal hai
Bawah... bawah ye seedhe maut...

Haan to chup, pehle mujhe kehn do
Kaan khule choro aur jaban bandh rehne do
Laagi tujhe hawah, (cause you got fans bro)
Todu teri chain cheenu chaain jaise Django
Tu hai akela to maine thana, ke ab hai khana bana na
Naklio ko mu chabata, ye mera Khana Khazana
Tu kaate par mai kata na, mai katu jaise Katana
Tu fukta karta bahana, mai fuka karta Malana
Mere saare peeche chupke, tik tik se
Hum ek jagah ni hai tikte, khit pit se
Bache. Tere saare gaane shit the, pit pit ke
Par hum chhut te hi hit the, sick likh te
Janhit me hai baat jari, hai jo jaan pyari
To haat utha haowa me, tujhe ni hai jaankari
Ke mai baantu gyan, par meri koi sanstha ni
Mera baap hai hip-hop, mai aulad sanskari

Ye mera khel meri chaal hai
Ye mera jaal hai, hum lajawab hai, hum la ilaj hai...
Satranj khel... satranj chaal hai...
Agar ye tera Taj hai
To hum yaha ke Ajmal Ali Kasab

Ye hai Seedhe maut
Sunke isko khate adhe cheete khauf
Ladke ladte sunke isko peeke bahut
Ye hai Seedhe maut
Sunke isko khate adhe cheete khauf
Ladke ladte sunke isko peeke bahut
Ye hai Seedhe maut
Sunke isko khate adhe cheete khauf
Ladke ladte sunke isko peeke bahut
Ye hai Seedhe maut
Sunke isko khate adhe cheete khauf
Ladke ladte sunke isko peeke bahut

Mind of a killer I considered I'll be quicker
I figured my figures could trigger more followers
On Twitter. Getting paid on recheck it's spending
Riches on make a concentrating into bigger things
Get to be heavy haters
I never knew, why hate us, our plan is fucked up
Our planet, fucked up. From up we went down
You know nothing sir, see
I'm spitting so much fire, your Khaleesi rides me
Who the best I might be, I might bring the 90s
Back. Setting up a level, you'll never reach my scene
Keep checking that last seen, on your phone 24x7
It might cost your dream. I plan to live mine
So I grind O.D.B
I'll bring the karma for the storm for my family
It's like I'm in a battlefield, all these rappers about to yield
And it's hard to see. Hard to feel
How did the beheaded by the prodigies
Well you can't say shit, cause you get our apologies

You can see that, feel that, we write
We're doing fine, we're doing fine, we're doing fine. Yehh
Kya tere gaane, kya teri hype...
This is how we swell you dime, you better learn it's about time

Ye hai Seedhe maut
Sunke isko khate adhe cheete khauf
Ladke ladte sunke isko peeke bahut
Ye hai Seedhe maut
Sunke isko khate adhe cheete khauf
Ladke ladte sunke isko peeke bahut
Ye hai Seedhe maut
Sunke isko khate adhe cheete khauf
Ladke ladte sunke isko peeke bahut
Ye hai Seedhe maut
Sunke isko khate adhe cheete khauf
Ladke ladte sunke isko peeke bahut
