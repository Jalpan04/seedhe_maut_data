We're running for royalty
You're running for
You're running for royalty
Running for royalty
You're running for
You're running for royalty
Running for royalty
We're running for
We're running for royalty
Running for royalty
We're running for
Fatti jebe kahein jaake jeb kaat le
Yeah we're running for royalty
Kati jebe kahein jaake jeb kaat le
Yeah we're running for royalty
Dhan ki talaash ki ye mann kare pehl
Yeah we're running for royalty
Hath ka nahi haan ye mann ka he mael
Yeah we're running for royalty

Karu baat god se
Talk time khali
Zabaan jese Nathuram Godse
Jebe mange hariyali
Jebe mange gandhi, jebe mange zindagi me aandhi
Paisa nasha pyaar, jeevan ke khiladi
Jebe mange chaar lambi gadi
Chaahe kalam aadi karni pade jese Kalamadi
Mene aage piche dekha mujhe bohat mile, job kiye
Ghoome college-on me bhi vo top kiye, drop kiye
Sapno ko unke ye khauf chahiye
Jab tankha me kattoti unka boss kiye (Ha!)
Shaatir zabaan
Shabdo ke teero pe dilki kamaan
Sapno se aage he daulat ke daam
Aur apno se upar he shohrat ki shaan
Paisa me paisa me paisa me paisa me
Paisa ke piche hi kesa sa rehta tha
Khudme par ab hu me dukhme
Hai Paisa ilaaj ye khudko me kehta tha
Tha mein khush mijaaz, ab khud pe shark bann ke
Karu sukh talaash aur dhuth dimaag ke saath
Mangu pyaar ki pyaas, bawaal
Dimaag pe dhan ki he dhun sawaar

We're running for royalty
Running for royalty
You're running for
You're running for royalty
Running for royalty

Fatti jebe kahein jaake jeb kaat le
Yeah we're running for royalty
Kati jebe kahein jaake jeb kaat le
Yeah we're running for royalty
Dhan ki talaash ki ye mann kare pehl
Yeah we're running for royalty
Hath ka nahi haan ye mann ka he mael
Yeah we're running for royalty
(Brr, brr!)

You're runnin' for nothing but money
We're nothing but dummies its funny
You got no food on the table
But Jordans are more important, start stunting
The world is a mess
Like Modi you got on the fly
Suit worth 10 lac, royalty right?
We've been spending on everything we're depending on
Copping everything on television
They're setting up a cobweb (yeah)
And its all set (wo!)
We've been walking in the trap since we learnt how to walk, Yeah
These companies are magnets attraction is what they say
Attracting the youth and we stupid
We running for royalty
No money no loyalty, more money more rivalry
If I ain't banking some cash will my momma be proud of me
Questions like this got shit burning inside of me
(Uoo!)
A mansion
Garage full of cars, a wall full of cash
We've been living a mirage, Imma do what i can
Manmade paper versus man
Imma talk about about what I dont have
Just to have but I don't have, half of the time
You got money on your mind
The devil on your side
Compelling you to rhyme
Where its all fucked up

'Cus we're running for royalty
We're running for
You're running for royalty
Running for royalty
You're running for
You're running for royalty
Running for royalty
We're running for
We're running for royalty
Running for royalty
We 're running for
Fatti jebe kahein jaake jeb kaat le
Yeah we're running for royalty
Kati jebe kahein jaake jeb kaat le
Yeah we're running for royalty
Dhan ki talaash ki ye mann kare pehl
Yeah we're running for royalty
Hath ka nahi haan ye mann ka he mael
Yeah we're running for royalty
Karun baat God se
Talk time khaali (khaali, khaali, khaali)
