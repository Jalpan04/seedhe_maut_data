(Sez on the beat boy)

Aasani se toote ye papad hai
Bagal me ebow to jote bhi chalu hai
Zara sa chaude me khada to hoke dekh aage ke mujhe nahi maalum hai
Aakhade me aake dekh
Tu maare kharaate mai maaru karate kick
Mo pe stash hai, Uday pe khamba, Encore tu kar parathe pick (Uhh)
Scene on!
Akkad bakkad bambey, yaha nahi lena pangey
Khaali peeli kaale peele hoge
Peele khade nake pe aur pehle peeli maine (Uhh)
Ek 100 ka note dega chodd tera bhai (chod dega bhai)
Ek mauka de dega fod tera bhai (haa)
Sab chahte rehna tujhse door
Tab hi kaate tere baal galat tera naai
Yaha bhatakne ka nahi (nai)
Ye circle kaafi zyaada tight (tight)
Me bola mera jaam gatakne ka nahi (nai)
Utaaru teri saari jhai (hey)
Me kyu sunu psy?
Deni hoti BT tumhe
Doori rakhu tabhi mai na
Zyaada karu baat
Kabhi lagi baat haath lage haath mere raaz thode
Bade baat aaj mera squad haath chode
Dilli ghuste hi tera bhai plug (hey)
Aankhein laal meri, cyclops
Inko zyaada fuka do to pooche mujhse paranoid hoke
"Bhai kaha hai cops?"
Seedhi baat hai teri baato pe ruchi na kisiko to
Aake ya bund mat chaat (pow pow pow pow)
Ek baar bola door reh na bolna pade mujhe
Doosri baar, to jhaatu

Aaja mere saath tujhe sir dard du
Tera baap kaun mujhe matlab nahi
Hare raam harkat aflatoon
Kare hum raaj tujhe koi shak nahi
Mai sankat hu
Bola mujhe kya oye kambakht tu?
Hau mera kaanoon aur ye sansad nahi
Badi baatcheet jaise aflatoon
Shit gets realer as I get older
Sang Froid just get colder
2, 2 chip all on my shoulder (yeah)
Kids keep acting all Cobra
I ain't tryna talk shit out this ain't oprah
How we doin' this Cosa Nostra
You man must be stuck on that coca
Thinking imma let it slide, roller coaster
In too many ___ like me
Thinkin' imma give it to 'em, that's a doner
Think imma keep my eye locked on a bag
Till i find me that Lisa, that Mona
Plotting that evil scheme, kill ya dream
Cleave Mclean, guillotine
Your demeanor IDI Amin
You get turfed, just like Billie Jean
I live the dream, I make moves
I came with the team
Flow for days like a river stream
Them man move just like Mr. Bean
Nowadays I twist the green to medicate
But it's hard to levitate
While I bear the weight
De-glare the hate of these brers that's fake
More cheddar plate, more share to take
That's a move I dare you make
Yam ya food, then I'll flare the palace
Trapped in room there's no air to waste
Besides I'm that goon you don't dare to chase
Got rap shook
Debo get that snack took
It's all clear, I'm that good
Disappear man, blackwood

Trippin'
You will never catch us slippin'
You will never catch man driftin'
We been on bits since an infant
Turn a big man to a victim
Trippin'
You will never catch us slippin'
You will never catch man driftin'
We been on bits since an infant
Turn a big man to a victim
(Encore ABJ)
Mazboot me muh pe nahi kehta
Khule jab thooth to zeus bhi moot deta
Button up, tu aur tu bane neta? (oye)
Pare hatt loot pe choot mai ni sehta
Chain meri custom
Likhu jaise premchand, pratham
Bhoook jaise krishna, flow jaise makkhhan
Trap gang saath poori satsang
1 lakh hai baap ni koi lakkhan (lakkhan)
Haye raam ye log hai ya lassan (lassan)
Hai unka tez mera maddham
Pav saath to laash bicche chhappan (well that's tuff)
Gaana drop bhage sab pee-pee
Fruity flow bite kare jaise leechi
Savdhaan sab hi jab flow blow kare seeti
Jaise PT, liya toone teer hi
Ghar me sawarti hai preeti
Vo pretty, vo seedhi si lagti hai aspara si
Maa chudaye kiki
Ab kare kya boss
Mera poora Youth Boss ass
Chipakne ka nahi sir dard yaha chhappan hai boss
Seena ni chhappan ka, dil hai picchhatar ka boss
Kagaz ke panno pe kalam se graffiti boss
Kissani ni kari par haiga yaha bhatera sauce
Bank me ni paisa to interest me bhatera loss
Karu me bhateri mauj
Show karu bhatere mosh
Ab bhi hia bhatera josh
Aankhe azeez, baate lazeez, gayab tameez, jaadugar
Jaadu jaadu jaadu jaadugar

Aaja dikhaa de fir ek naya jaadu kar
Aaja mere saath tujhe sir dard du
Tera baap kaun mujhe matlab nahi
Hare raam harkat aflatoon
Kare hum raaj tujhe koi shak nahi
Mai sankat hu
Bola mujhe kya oye kambakht tu?
Hau mera kaanoon aur ye sansad nahi
Badi baatcheet jaise aflatoon

Blackout blackout blackout
Beggar fam Seedhe Maut no handout
I was in habitat, cold for the smackdown
You was in fix still tryna put a track out
Studio done, big Mo put the track out
Back on tour with the gang for the cash-out
Back on the ends for a minute then I'm back out
Bombay dreaming, get the pack for the cats out
Yo, I run the rave from cuff parade to Bandra
Stash 2 bits on a girl called Deandra
Done the dance and came from one stanza
Count dough in the ricks, no extravaganza
Mahim pahoch ke, jump in the Padmini
Now I'm on the sealink, tryna holler at Nandini
Bollywood gyal, wanna know so they atting(@) me
Hit them with the like, get the follow back casually
She was like "come to the Novotel"
Calm was like "nahi yaar, go to hell"
Heading back to lower parel, got my ting shotgun and she strappin' the L
(Location dikhao, button dabao
Flex dikhao, Bud pilao
Goli lagao, buzzer bajao
Andar to aao, choli uthaao)
Wax off wax on cognac straps on now she backin' the long
She backin' it good, she got me hittin' it strong
She got me givin it the biggun while she singing my song
No long: PAV no villager, POV no cinema
BKC no byculla, all up in that ass no enema
